## DATA
### Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
### Genome dataset is composed of:
  - 99 de novo genome assemblies from novel Oxford Nanopore sequencing data
  - 18 de novo genome assemblies from published Oxford Nanopore sequencing data
  - 19 de novo genome assemblies from published PacBio sequencing data
  - 1 refernce genome S288C
### SV list as a csv file
### Annotation files (gff3)

## Analyses
### Telomere sequence length
### tRNA gene families
### Retrotransposons (Ty)

## Programming

### Refactoring

#### In progress / Done

- Setting up a good developping environment (SublimeText + plugins)

- Improved CLI:
  - Replacing sys.argv by argparse.
  - Argparse help.
  - See Different types of arguments/options.
  
- Refactoring spaghetti code into specialized functions + docstrings.

- Accepting single fasta file or recursively applied to fasta files in a
  directory.
  
- Usage of pathlib.

#### To do

- algorithm study/improvements
- tests

if time:
- logging in python
